# py3bt_tracker

py3bt_tracker is a cross-platform standalone ephemeral tracker for torrents written in Python3.

The development emphasis is on zero-configuration "just works" software.

Currently implemented using a multidimentional array in memory and the Tornado Web Server (http).

## Key Features:

- Works
- Prebuilt binaries
- No external dependencies or configuration required
- Permissive license
- Standards compliant (including IPv6 support)
- Easy to rebuild from source if so inclined (check release_notes.txt for detailed instructions)

## Download:

```
Latest Release: 1.0.0-rc.1
In Development: 1.0.0-rc.2
```
Click [here](https://github.com/gdiaz384/py3bt_tracker/releases) or on "releases" at the top to download the latest version.

## Typical Usage Guide:

1. double click on the .exe for your os
2. point your torrents to http://192.168.1.50:6969/announce where 192.168.1.50 gets substituted for your IP obtained from ipconfig (for lans)
3. Note: If the firewall annoyance pops up, add as an exception.

## Release Notes Summary:

- By default, runs on port 6969, with a check-in interval of 4 minutes
- Currently no scrape/statistics/private/logging/obfuscation features
- Intended use case is for LANs. Will also work on the internet, but not currently optimized for it.
- If there's any interest in doing so, I'll do a version 2.0.0 for optimized use on the internetwork system, with UDP/obfuscation support, since that's the natural extension to this project. Just message me over git.

## Advanced Usage Guide:
```
Syntax: py3bt_tracker {--port=6969} {--client_request_interval=4} {--enable_obfuscation}
Syntax: py3bt_tracker {-p=9000} {-i=30} {-o}
>py3bt_tracker --help
>py3bt_tracker
>py3bt_tracker --port=6969
>py3bt_tracker -p=6969
>py3bt_tracker -p=6969 -i=4
>py3bt_tracker -p=80 --client_request_interval=15
Windows (binary): >start "" C:\Users\User\Downloads\py3bt_tracker.exe --port=9000
Windows (pyscript): >start "" python C:\Users\User\Downloads\py3bt_tracker.py -i=30
```

Notes: obfuscation not currently implemented, planned for v2.0.0 if there's enough interest
