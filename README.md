# py3bt_tracker

py3bt_tracker.py is a cross-platform standalone ephemeral tracker for torrents written in Python3.

The development emphasis is on zero-configuration "just works" software.

Currently implemented using a multidimentional array in memory and the Tornado Web Server.

## Key Features:

1. Works
2. Prebuilt binaries
3. No external dependencies or configuration required
4. Permissive license
5. Standards Compliant
6. Easy to rebuild from source if so inclined (detailed instructions provided in dont_readme.txt)

## Download:

```
Latest Release: v1.0.0-rc.1
In Development: v1.0.0
```
Click [here](https://github.com/gdiaz384/py3bt_tracker/releases) or on "releases" at the top to download the latest version.

## Usage guide:

1. double click on the .exe for your os
2. point your torrents to http://127.0.0.1:9000/announce where 127.0.0.1 is substituted for your IP obtained from ipconfig (for lans)
3. Note: If the firewall annoyance pops up, add as an exception.

google_define('ephemeral') #returns: adjective - lasting for a very short time -synonyms: transient, short-lived, brief

## Important Release Notes:

1. Runs on port 9000, with a requested check-in interval of 4 minutes by default (change via command line)
2. Intended use case is in a LAN enviornment, will also work on the internet, but not currently optimized for it.
3. Currently no scrape/statistics/ipv6/private/logging features
4. IPv6, UDP support and obfuscation features might be added at some point


## Example usage:
```
Syntax: py3bt_tracker {port='9000'} {interval='4'} {obfuscation='off'}
py3bt_tracker --help
py3bt_tracker
py3bt_tracker 6969
py3bt_tracker 9000 4
py3bt_tracker 6969 16 off
py3bt_tracker 8080 30 on
Windows (binary):  start "" C:\Users\User\Downloads\py3bt_tracker.exe 9000 10
Windows (pyscript): start "" python C:\Users\User\Downloads\py3bt_tracker.py 6969
```

Notes: obfuscation not currently implemented, planned for v2.0 (maybe)

If I get any questions, I'm changing this to "beerware" and will refuse to elaborate further. You've been warned.
