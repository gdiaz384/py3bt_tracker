#Stateful information to keep track of
1) each torrent 
-torrent_info_hashes
-maps various info_hash(es) each to a client_list (strings) 
-each string identifies a client_list table
-each client_list table has an entry per client
-each entry has the peer id, ip, port

2) complete for this torrent - number of peers with the entire file (reported completed)
3) incomplete for this torrent- number of non-seeder peers (reported starts that have not been moved to complete)
4) list of peers associated with torrent (peer id, IP (ipv4/ipv6) and port,lastHeardFrom)
-4) has a peer_id (whatever the peer sent), and then nested values


#internal variables
#maximum number of peers to report
max_peers_to_report=30
# A string that the client should send back on its next announcements
tracker_id=bt_tracker


responses are:
failure reason
or
warning message+response
or 
response
response=interval,tracker id, complete, incomplete, peers(binary)


#peers (dictionary)
-peers
-peer id    (string)
-ip       (ipv6 hex, ipv4 dotted, dns string)
-port     (int)

#peers (binary) (compact response), string consisting of multiples of 6 bytes. First 4 bytes are the IP address and last 2 bytes are the port number. All in network (big endian) notation
